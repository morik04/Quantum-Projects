# Quantum-Practice and Projects

Grovers Algorithim: Code playing around with grovers algorithim. I used Ibms qiskit tutorials for help, however they only ran it on a simulator, I added the running on quantum hardware part towards the end. Also in the tutorial they were using qiskit 0.46 or under, as some fucntions did not work, I rewrote it so it can run on qiskit 1.4.2 the current model. Only 3 quibits were in the incorrect position due to quantum noise. In the future I would like to expand the number of strings, and apply it to a real world application, like searching through files or for a resturant. 
Grovers Resturant and Grovers Dinner Party are used. In these cases they are not singificantly better, but since they have a quadratic advantadge they will outperfom classical algorythyms better. Also these were run on simulators not the actual QPU
