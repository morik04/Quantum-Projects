# Quantum-Practice and Projects

Grovers: Code playing around with grovers algorithim. I used Ibms qiskit tutorials for help, however they only ran it on a simulator, I added the running on quantum hardware part towards the end. Only 3 quibits were in the incorrect position. In the future I would like to expand the number of strings, and apply it to a real world application, like searching through files or for a resturant.
